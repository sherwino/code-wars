1. Given two integers, which can be positive and negative, find the sum of all the numbers between including them too and return it. If both numbers are equal return a or b.

Note! a and b are not ordered!

### Examples/Tests:
```
GetSum(1, 0) == 1   // 1 + 0 = 1
GetSum(1, 2) == 3   // 1 + 2 = 3
GetSum(0, 1) == 1   // 0 + 1 = 1
GetSum(1, 1) == 1   // 1 Since both are same
GetSum(-1, 0) == -1 // -1 + 0 = -1
GetSum(-1, 2) == 2  // -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2
```


2. Polycarpus works as a DJ in the best Berland nightclub, and he often uses dubstep music in his performance. Recently, he has decided to take a couple of old songs and make dubstep remixes from them.

  Let's assume that a song consists of some number of words. To make the dubstep remix of this song, Polycarpus inserts a certain number of words "WUB" before the first word of the song (the number may be zero), after the last word (the number may be zero), and between words (at least one between any pair of neighbouring words), and then the boy glues together all the words, including "WUB", in one string and plays the song at the club.

  For example, a song with words "I AM X" can transform into a dubstep remix as "WUBWUBIWUBAMWUBWUBX" and cannot transform into "WUBWUBIAMWUBX".

  Recently, Jonny has heard Polycarpus's new dubstep track, but since he isn't into modern music, he decided to find out what was the initial song that Polycarpus remixed. Help Jonny restore the original song.

 ### Input

  The input consists of a single non-empty string, consisting only of uppercase English letters, the string's length doesn't exceed 200 characters

 ### Output

  Return the words of the initial song that Polycarpus used to make a dubsteb remix. Separate the words with a space.

### Examples/Tests:
```
songDecoder("WUBWEWUBAREWUBWUBTHEWUBCHAMPIONSWUBMYWUBFRIENDWUB")
  // =>  WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS MY FRIEND
```

3. You live in the city of Cartesia where all roads are laid out in a perfect grid. You arrived ten minutes too early to an appointment, so you decided to take the opportunity to go for a short walk. The city provides its citizens with a Walk Generating App on their phones -- everytime you press the button it sends you an array of one-letter strings representing directions to walk (eg. ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']). You know it takes you one minute to traverse one city block, so create a function that will return true if the walk the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes (you don't want to be early or late!) and will, of course, return you to your starting point. Return false otherwise.

Note: you will always receive a valid array containing a random assortment of direction letters ('n', 's', 'e', or 'w' only). It will never give you an empty array (that's not a walk, that's standing still!)

### Examples/Tests:
```
Test.expect(isValidWalk(['n','s','n','s','n','s','n','s','n','s']), 'should return true');
Test.expect(!isValidWalk(['w','e','w','e','w','e','w','e','w','e','w','e']), 'should return false');
Test.expect(!isValidWalk(['w']), 'should return false');
Test.expect(!isValidWalk(['n','n','n','s','n','s','n','s','n','s']), 'should return false');

```


4. EXTRA CREDIT - this is a sample problem from [codility.com]


A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of N.

For example, number 9 has binary representation 1001 and contains a binary gap of length 2. The number 529 has binary representation 1000010001 and contains two binary gaps: one of length 4 and one of length 3. The number 20 has binary representation 10100 and contains one binary gap of length 1. The number 15 has binary representation 1111 and has no binary gaps.

### Write a function:
```
    int solution(int N);
```
that, given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary gap. The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.

For example, given N = 1041 the function should return 5, because N has binary representation 10000010001 and so its longest binary gap is of length 5.

### Assume that:
```
        N is an integer within the range [1..2,147,483,647].
```
### Complexity:
```
        expected worst-case time complexity is O(log(N));
        expected worst-case space complexity is O(1).
```
